Want to help me make this thing awesome? Great! Here's how you should get started.

1. Because PouchDB is still developing so rapidly, you'll want to clone `git@github.com:daleharvey/pouchdb.git`, and run `npm link` from the root folder of your clone.
2. Fork **express-pouchdb**, and clone it to your local machine.
3. From the root folder of your clone run `npm link pouchdb` to install PouchDB from your local repository from Step 1.
4. `npm install`

Please make your changes on a separate branch whose name reflects your changes, push them to your fork, and open a pull request!
